# mitmproxyusefulscripts


here are some scripts i wrote using mitmproxy functionalities. i originally wrote them to run with my Rasperry Pi but the scripts seem to run as good as it is on my computer. you can check https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/addons-scripting/ if you want to see how i made the scripts, along with the basis of mitmproxy.
